# This is a placeholder for an Excel file
# The actual Excel file would have the following columns:
# Column 1: Auto-count for questions (1, 2, 3, etc.)
# Column 2: Question type (Multiple Choice, True/False, Fill in Blank, Matching, Short Answer)
# Column 3: Question text
# Column 4: Multiple choice option A
# Column 5: Multiple choice option B  
# Column 6: Multiple choice option C
# Column 7: Multiple choice option D
# Column 8: Correct answer
# Column 9: Notes

# Since I cannot create actual Excel files, I'll create a CSV template instead
