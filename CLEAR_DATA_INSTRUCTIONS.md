## 🎯 **TO CLEAR JUST THE STUDENT DATA:**

Go to your Supabase SQL Editor:
```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]/sql
```

### **Step 2: Copy & Paste This SQL:**
Open the file `clear-database-records.sql` and run it in Supabase.

**This will:**
- ✅ **Clear all student records** from all tables
- ✅ **Keep all table structures** (students, performance, etc.)

### **Step 3: Verify Clean State**
After running the SQL, you should see:
```sql
-- All tables exist but empty:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students_unified; -- Should return 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM g4; -- Should return 0  
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM g5; -- Should return 0
-- etc.
```
