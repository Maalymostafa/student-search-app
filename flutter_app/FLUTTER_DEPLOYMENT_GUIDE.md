SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
```

### API Configuration

Update `lib/utils/constants.dart`:
```dart
class ApiConfig {
  // For production
  static const String baseUrl = 'https://your-app.vercel.app';
  
  // For local development
  // static const String baseUrl = 'http://localhost:3000';
}
```

### App Configuration

Update `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
name: student_search_app
description: Student search application - Mrs. Hoda Ismail
version: 1.0.0+1

# For iOS
ios:
  bundle_identifier: com.yourcompany.studentsearchapp

# For Android
android:
  application_id: com.yourcompany.studentsearchapp
```

## 🧪 Testing Before Deployment

## 🚀 Advanced Deployment

### Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

**GitHub Actions** - Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:
```yaml
name: Deploy Flutter Web
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          flutter-version: '3.0.0'
      - run: flutter pub get
      - run: flutter build web
      - uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.ORG_ID }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID }}
          working-directory: ./build/web
```

### Performance Optimization

1. **Enable release mode**:
   ```bash
   flutter run --release
   ```

2. **Optimize images**:
   - Use WebP format
   - Compress images
   - Use appropriate sizes

3. **Code optimization**:
   ```bash
   flutter analyze
   flutter test
   ```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Flutter command not found"**:
   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"
   ```

2. **"No supported devices connected"**:
   ```bash
   flutter devices
   flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>
   ```

3. **"Package not found"**:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Web build issues**:
   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-web
   flutter create .
   ```

5. **iOS build issues**:
   ```bash
   cd ios
   pod install
   cd ..
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

### Performance Issues

1. **Slow loading**:
   - Enable gzip compression
   - Use CDN for assets
   - Optimize images

2. **Large bundle size**:
   - Remove unused dependencies
   - Enable tree shaking
   - Use dynamic imports

## 📊 Analytics and Monitoring

### Firebase Analytics
```yaml
dependencies:
  firebase_analytics: ^10.0.0
```

### Crash Reporting
```yaml
dependencies:
  firebase_crashlytics: ^3.0.0
```
