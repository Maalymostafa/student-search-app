- `password_reset_tokens` - Password recovery
- `login_attempts` - Security

**No unused tables to remove!** All are essential.

**Your 5 Sheets:**
1. **Main Registration Sheet** - Student basic info
2. **Performance Data Sheet** - Academic performance
3. **Contact Information Sheet** - Parent/guardian contacts

# This creates all tables (empty)
```

### Step 2: Test Empty App

# Install APK on your phone
# Open the app
# You'll see empty lists (this is expected!)
```

### Step 3: Import Real Data
```bash
# Run the import scripts
# Your 5 Google Sheets will be imported
# App will now show real data
```

### Step 4: Test Features
